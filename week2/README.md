- **align_seqs_fasta.py** :Calculate the match score between two sequences. Print and save the best score and best sequence.

- **align_seqs_better.py** :Compared to `align_seqs.py` and `align_seqs_fasta.py`, instead of taking the first of the alignments with the highest score, this script records all the equally-best alignments and saves to the results directory in and appropriate file format.

- **oaks_debugme.py** :A group work on updating a debugging practice using doctests to make sure there is no bug

- **cfexercises1.py** :Modified cfexercises1.all the foo_x functions taken arguments from the user (like the functions inside control_flow.py)

- **control_flow.py** :An example of using various control flow tools in the standard python program structure

- **dictionary.py** :Fills the taxa_dic dictionary, which is derived from taxa and maps sequential names to taxon sets.

- **lc1.py** :Create lists from *birds* data using comprehension and loops as required.

- **lc2.py** :Creating lists from *rainfall* data using comprehension and loops as required.

- **oaks_debugme.py** :Debug the function then output taxa belonging to oaks from a list of species.

- **oaks.py:** :Find taxa belonging to oaks from a list of species.

- **test_ontrol_flow.py** :Docstring debugging of control_flow.py.
