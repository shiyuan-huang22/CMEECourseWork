## Project structure and Usage 
<br/>

### Data Management and Visualization: 

- **fmr.R:** Plots log(field metabolic rate) against log(body mass) for the Nagy et al 1999 dataset to a file fmr.pdf.

- **LV1.py:** Example of numerical integration to solve the Lotka-Volterra model and plot.

- **LV2.py:** Example of numerical integration to solve the Lotka-Volterra model and plot and it takes arguments for the four LV model parameters r, a, z, e from the command line.

- **MyFirstJupyterNb.ipynb:** My first example jupyter file.

- **profileme.py:** Find out what slowed down the scripts.

- **profileme2.py:** Find out what slowed down the scripts, and we did two things to improve the script:converted the loop to a list comprehension, and replaced the .join with an explicit string concatenation. 

- **run_fmr_R.py:** This script is for running fmr.R.

- **run_LV.py:** Comparing the running speed between LV1.py and LV2.py.

- **test.py:** Example of numerical computing in Python.

- **TestR.py:** This script is for running TestR.R

- **timeitme.py:** Using timeit to test loops vs. list comprehensions to find which is faster.

- **using_os.py:** This is example of using subprocess.
